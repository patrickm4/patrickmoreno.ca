				<p>
					I started my journey quite early attempting to understand big books on HTML from the library in elementary. In highschool I was manipulating webpages and graphics on social sites for friends and myself. After trying out some Java and C++ courses in my under grad I changed my studies over to software engineering. Completed a diploma in Digital Design & Development from British Columbia Institute of Technology with distinction.
